# User Isolation Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented comprehensive user authentication and model ownership to ensure each user can only see and access their own uploaded models.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. User Authentication System
- **Session-based authentication** with Bearer tokens
- **User registration and login** with email/password
- **Token expiration** (24 hours)
- **In-memory user and session storage** for demo purposes

### 2. Model Ownership
- **User ID association** - Each model is linked to the user who uploaded it
- **Access control** - Users can only access their own models
- **Filtered endpoints** - All model-related endpoints filter by user ID

### 3. Security Features
- **Authentication middleware** on all protected endpoints
- **Token validation** with expiration checking
- **Access control** for model operations (view, predict, delete)
- **User-specific statistics** and monitoring

## Implementation Details

### Authentication Middleware
```javascript
function authenticateUser(req, res, next) {
  const authHeader = req.headers.authorization;
  const token = authHeader && authHeader.split(' ')[1];
  
  // Token validation and session checking
  // Sets req.user for authenticated requests
}
```

### User-Specific Model Storage
```javascript
const newModel = {
  id: modelId,
  name: modelName,
  // ... other fields
  userId: userId,        // Links model to user
  userEmail: userEmail   // For debugging/display
};
```

### Protected Endpoints
All model-related endpoints now require authentication:
- `GET /api/models` - Returns only user's models
- `POST /api/models/upload` - Associates uploaded model with user
- `GET /api/models/:id` - Only returns model if owned by user
- `POST /api/predict/:modelId` - Only allows prediction on user's models

## User Flow

### 1. Registration/Login
```javascript
// Login with email/password
POST /api/auth/login
{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "password": "password"
}

// Returns token for subsequent requests
{
  "token": "token-user-example-com-1234567890",
  "user": { "id": "user-example-com", "email": "user@example.com" }
}
```

### 2. Model Upload
```javascript
// Upload with authentication
POST /api/models/upload
Authorization: Bearer token-user-example-com-1234567890

// Model is automatically associated with authenticated user
```

### 3. Model Access
```javascript
// Get user's models only
GET /api/models
Authorization: Bearer token-user-example-com-1234567890

// Returns only models uploaded by this user
```

## Testing User Isolation

### Test Scenario 1: Different Users, Different Models
1. **User A** logs in as `user1@example.com`
2. **User A** uploads "Model A"
3. **User B** logs in as `user2@example.com`
4. **User B** uploads "Model B"
5. **User A** sees only "Model A"
6. **User B** sees only "Model B"

### Test Scenario 2: Cross-User Access Prevention
1. **User A** uploads a model (gets model ID: `model-user1-123`)
2. **User B** tries to access `model-user1-123`
3. **Result**: 404 Not Found (access denied)

### Test Scenario 3: Prediction Access Control
1. **User A** uploads a model
2. **User B** tries to make predictions on User A's model
3. **Result**: 404 Not Found (model not accessible)

## Debug and Testing Tools

### Enhanced Debug Endpoint
- `GET /api/debug/models` - Shows user-specific debug info when authenticated
- Displays total users, sessions, and user-specific model counts

### Updated Debug Tool
- `debug-upload-issue.html` now includes authentication testing
- Test login/logout functionality
- Test user-specific model operations

## Frontend Integration

### Automatic Token Handling
The existing frontend already properly handles authentication:
- Stores tokens in localStorage
- Includes Bearer token in API requests
- Handles login/logout flows

### No Frontend Changes Needed
The user isolation is transparent to the frontend - it continues to work exactly the same way, but now only shows user-specific data.

## Security Benefits

1. **Data Privacy** - Users cannot see other users' models
2. **Access Control** - Users cannot access or predict on models they don't own
3. **Resource Isolation** - User statistics and monitoring are user-specific
4. **Audit Trail** - Each model is linked to its owner for accountability

## Production Considerations

For production deployment, consider:
1. **Database storage** instead of in-memory storage
2. **JWT tokens** with proper signing and validation
3. **Password hashing** with bcrypt or similar
4. **Rate limiting** per user
5. **Session management** with Redis or similar
6. **HTTPS enforcement** for token security

## Testing Instructions

1. **Deploy the updated code** to Render
2. **Test with multiple users**:
   - Register/login as `user1@example.com`
   - Upload a model
   - Register/login as `user2@example.com`
   - Upload a different model
   - Verify each user only sees their own models
3. **Test cross-user access**:
   - Try to access another user's model ID directly
   - Verify access is denied
4. **Use debug tool** at `/debug-upload-issue.html` for detailed testing

The user isolation is now fully implemented and ensures complete data privacy between users.
