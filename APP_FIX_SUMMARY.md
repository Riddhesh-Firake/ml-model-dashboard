# App Constructor Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Method Binding Error
**Problem:** `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'bind')` at line 20 in app.js
**Root Cause:** Trying to bind `this.handleLogout` but the method was named `logout()`
**Fix:** Changed binding from `this.handleLogout` to `this.logout`

### 2. Method Indentation Issues
**Problem:** Several methods were not properly indented as class methods
**Methods Fixed:**
- `showLoginForm()`
- `createLoginModal()`
- `showRegisterForm()`
- `createRegisterModal()`
- `createFormGroup()`

**Fix:** Added proper indentation (4 spaces) to make them class methods

### 3. Missing Method Bindings
**Problem:** Some methods were called but not bound in constructor
**Added Bindings:**
- `this.showModelDetails`
- `this.handleInitialLoad`
- `this.showLoginForm`
- `this.showRegisterForm`
- `this.createLoginModal`
- `this.createRegisterModal`
- `this.createFormGroup`
