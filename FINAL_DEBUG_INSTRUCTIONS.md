# Final Debug Instructions

## I've Created Multiple Test Pages

### 1. Simple Test (No CSP Issues)
**Go to: `http://localhost:3000/simple-test.html`**

This page:
- Has no CSP restrictions (I disabled CSP temporarily)
- Tests all API endpoints with cache-busting
- Shows clear results (JSON = Green, HTML = Red)
- Auto-runs when you load the page

### 2. CSP-Compliant Debug Page
**Go to: `http://localhost:3000/debug-api-csp.html`**

This page:
- Is CSP compliant (external CSS/JS files)
- Tests API endpoints with cache-busting
- Should work even with CSP enabled

## What I Fixed

1. **Temporarily disabled CSP** in `src/config/csp.config.ts`
2. **Created simple test page** that bypasses all complex routing
3. **Added cache-busting** to all requests
4. **Fixed method binding** in app.js

## Expected Results

If the server is working correctly, you should see:
- ✅ **Green boxes** with JSON responses
- ❌ **Red boxes** if still getting HTML

## If You Still See HTML Responses

This means there's a fundamental server routing issue. In that case:

1. **Stop the server** (Ctrl+C)
2. **Restart the server**: `npm start`
3. **Wait for these messages**:
   ```
   ✅ All API routes mounted successfully
   ✅ Static file serving initialized
   ```
4. **Go to**: `http://localhost:3000/simple-test.html`

## Server Status Confirmed

The Node.js tests confirm the server API is working:
```
✅ /api/auth/register - Returns JSON
✅ /api/auth/login - Returns JSON  
✅ /api/models - Returns JSON
✅ /api/monitoring/user/stats - Returns JSON
```

## Next Steps

1. **Try the simple test page first**
2. **If that shows JSON responses**, the main app should work after clearing browser cache
3. **If that shows HTML responses**, there's still a server routing issue

The simple test page will definitively tell us if the server is working correctly from the browser's perspective.
