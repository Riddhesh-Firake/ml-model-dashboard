# Browser Cache Fix Instructions

## The Problem
Your browser is still loading old JavaScript files that have the API routing issues. Even though the server is fixed, the browser is using cached versions of the files.

## The Solution

### Method 1: Hard Refresh (Recommended)
1. Open your browser to `http://localhost:3000`
2. Press `Ctrl + F5` (Windows) or `Cmd + Shift + R` (Mac)
3. This will force reload all files and bypass the cache

### Method 2: Developer Tools Cache Clear
1. Open Developer Tools (`F12`)
2. Right-click the refresh button (while dev tools are open)
3. Select "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"

### Method 3: Manual Cache Clear
1. Open Developer Tools (`F12`)
2. Go to Application tab → Storage → Clear Storage
3. Click "Clear site data"
4. Refresh the page

### Method 4: Incognito/Private Mode
1. Open an incognito/private browser window
2. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`
3. This will load fresh files without any cache

## Verification Steps

After clearing cache, you should see:

1. **Console Logs Should Show:**
   ```
   ✅ API Success Response (JSON): {userStats: {...}}
   ✅ API Success Response (JSON): []  // for models
   ```

2. **No More Errors Like:**
   ```
   ❌ Received HTML instead of JSON - possible routing issue
   ```

3. **Upload Should Work:**
   - No "XMLHttpRequest state" errors
   - Proper model ID in endpoint URL (not "undefined")

4. **Navigation Should Work:**
   - No "Illegal invocation" errors
   - Smooth page transitions

## Test Upload After Cache Clear

1. Go to Upload page
2. Select a `.pkl`, `.joblib`, `.h5`, `.onnx`, `.pt`, or `.pth` file
3. Enter a model name
4. Click Upload
5. Should see success message with proper endpoint URL

## Expected Results

- ✅ Dashboard loads with proper user stats
- ✅ Models page shows uploaded models (if any)
- ✅ Upload works without errors
- ✅ Navigation works smoothly
- ✅ No console errors about HTML vs JSON

## If Issues Persist

If you still see issues after clearing cache:

1. Check the Network tab in Developer Tools
2. Look for any requests returning HTML instead of JSON
3. Verify the server is running on port 3000
4. Try restarting the server: `npm start`

The server-side fixes are working correctly as confirmed by our API tests. The browser just needs to load the updated files.
