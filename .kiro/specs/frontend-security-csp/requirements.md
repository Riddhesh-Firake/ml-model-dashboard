# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses Content Security Policy (CSP) violations and frontend security issues in the ML model dashboard. The system currently has inline event handlers that violate CSP directives, preventing proper security enforcement. This spec focuses on refactoring the frontend to be CSP-compliant while maintaining all existing functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a security-conscious platform operator, I want the frontend to comply with Content Security Policy directives, so that the application is protected against XSS attacks and other security vulnerabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL not use any inline event handlers in HTML
2. WHEN CSP headers are enforced THEN the system SHALL not generate any CSP violation errors
3. WHEN users interact with UI elements THEN the system SHALL use properly attached event listeners instead of inline handlers
4. WHEN the application runs THEN the system SHALL implement a strict CSP policy without 'unsafe-inline' directives
5. IF CSP violations occur THEN the system SHALL log them for monitoring and debugging

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to click on uploaded ML models and interact with the dashboard, so that I can manage my models without encountering security-related errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks on an uploaded model THEN the system SHALL respond without CSP violations
2. WHEN model interactions are triggered THEN the system SHALL use event delegation or proper event binding
3. WHEN dynamic content is loaded THEN the system SHALL avoid inline scripts and use external JavaScript files
4. WHEN forms are submitted THEN the system SHALL use programmatic event handling instead of inline handlers
5. IF JavaScript needs to be executed THEN the system SHALL use nonce-based or hash-based CSP allowlisting

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clean, maintainable frontend code that follows security best practices, so that the application is easier to maintain and more secure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN frontend code is written THEN the system SHALL separate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript concerns
2. WHEN event handlers are needed THEN the system SHALL use addEventListener or framework-specific event binding
3. WHEN dynamic styling is required THEN the system SHALL use CSS classes instead of inline styles
4. WHEN the application initializes THEN the system SHALL use a centralized event management system
5. IF third-party scripts are included THEN the system SHALL use proper CSP directives for external resources

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want comprehensive CSP headers configured, so that the application has defense-in-depth security against various attack vectors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN HTTP responses are sent THEN the system SHALL include appropriate CSP headers
2. WHEN resources are loaded THEN the system SHALL restrict sources to trusted domains only
3. WHEN scripts execute THEN the system SHALL use nonce or hash-based script allowlisting
4. WHEN styles are applied THEN the system SHALL prevent inline styles unless explicitly allowed
5. IF CSP violations are detected THEN the system SHALL report them to a monitoring endpoint

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want all existing functionality to work seamlessly after security improvements, so that my workflow is not disrupted by the security enhancements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the security fixes are applied THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing model management features
2. WHEN users upload models THEN the system SHALL continue to work without functional regressions
3. WHEN the dashboard loads THEN the system SHALL display all model information correctly
4. WHEN API calls are made THEN the system SHALL continue to function as before the security changes
5. IF user interactions fail THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and fallback options
