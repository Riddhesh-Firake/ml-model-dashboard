# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables users to upload their machine learning model files (such as .pkl, .joblib, .h5, .onnx, etc.) to the website and automatically generates API endpoints for model inference. The system will handle file validation, storage, and create RESTful endpoints that allow users to make predictions using their uploaded models.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a data scientist, I want to upload my trained ML model files to the platform, so that I can quickly deploy them as web APIs without managing infrastructure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects a model file THEN the system SHALL validate the file format against supported types (.pkl, .joblib, .h5, .onnx, .pt, .pth)
2. WHEN a user uploads a valid model file THEN the system SHALL store the file securely with a unique identifier
3. WHEN a model file exceeds the size limit THEN the system SHALL reject the upload and display an appropriate error message
4. WHEN a user uploads a model THEN the system SHALL require them to provide a model name and description
5. IF the upload is successful THEN the system SHALL display a confirmation message with the generated API endpoint URL

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automatically generated API endpoints for uploaded models, so that I can integrate ML predictions into my applications without additional setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a model is successfully uploaded THEN the system SHALL automatically generate a unique API endpoint URL
2. WHEN a POST request is made to the model endpoint THEN the system SHALL accept input data in JSON format
3. WHEN valid input data is provided THEN the system SHALL load the model and return predictions in JSON format
4. WHEN invalid input data is provided THEN the system SHALL return a 400 error with validation details
5. IF the model fails to load or predict THEN the system SHALL return a 500 error with appropriate error message

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to manage my uploaded models, so that I can update, delete, or monitor the usage of my deployed models.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views their dashboard THEN the system SHALL display all their uploaded models with status information
2. WHEN a user clicks on a model THEN the system SHALL show model details including endpoint URL, upload date, and usage statistics
3. WHEN a user deletes a model THEN the system SHALL remove the file and deactivate the associated API endpoint
4. WHEN a user updates model metadata THEN the system SHALL save the changes without affecting the API endpoint
5. IF a model endpoint receives requests THEN the system SHALL track and display usage metrics

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want to ensure secure and efficient model hosting, so that the system remains stable and protected from malicious uploads.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a file is uploaded THEN the system SHALL scan for malicious content before processing
2. WHEN multiple requests hit a model endpoint THEN the system SHALL implement rate limiting per user/API key
3. WHEN a model is inactive for a specified period THEN the system SHALL optionally archive or notify the user
4. WHEN system resources are constrained THEN the system SHALL implement request queuing for model inference
5. IF authentication is required THEN the system SHALL validate API keys or user tokens before allowing access

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want clear documentation and testing capabilities for model endpoints, so that I can easily integrate and test the ML models.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a model endpoint is created THEN the system SHALL generate interactive API documentation
2. WHEN a user views the model details THEN the system SHALL provide example request/response formats
3. WHEN a user wants to test their model THEN the system SHALL provide a built-in testing interface
4. WHEN API documentation is accessed THEN the system SHALL show required input schema and expected output format
5. IF the model requires specific preprocessing THEN the system SHALL document any data format requirements
