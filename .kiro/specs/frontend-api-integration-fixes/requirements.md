# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The frontend application is experiencing critical API integration failures that prevent core functionality from working. Users cannot access dashboard data, upload models, or navigate properly due to API routing issues, XMLHttpRequest state errors, and navigation handler failures. This feature will systematically fix these integration issues to restore full frontend functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want API endpoints to return proper JSON responses instead of HTML, so that the frontend can consume data correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the frontend requests `/api/monitoring/user/stats` THEN the system SHALL return JSON data with proper Content-Type headers
2. WHEN the frontend requests `/api/models` THEN the system SHALL return JSON array of models with proper Content-Type headers
3. WHEN any API endpoint is called THEN the system SHALL NOT return HTML content unless specifically requesting a web page
4. WHEN API routing fails THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error responses in JSON format

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to upload ML models successfully, so that I can use the model management features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I submit a model upload form THEN the XMLHttpRequest SHALL be in the correct state for header setting
2. WHEN the upload process starts THEN the system SHALL properly initialize the request before setting headers
3. WHEN an upload fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages to the user
4. WHEN an upload succeeds THEN the system SHALL confirm successful upload and update the UI

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want navigation to work properly, so that I can move between different sections of the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click navigation elements THEN the system SHALL handle navigation without throwing "Illegal invocation" errors
2. WHEN navigation handlers are bound THEN the system SHALL properly maintain the correct `this` context
3. WHEN page transitions occur THEN the system SHALL update the UI state correctly
4. WHEN navigation fails THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle errors and maintain application stability

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling and logging, so that I can diagnose and fix issues quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API requests fail THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information including endpoint, status, and response
2. WHEN frontend errors occur THEN the system SHALL capture and log stack traces for debugging
3. WHEN routing issues happen THEN the system SHALL identify whether the problem is client-side or server-side
4. WHEN errors are logged THEN the system SHALL include sufficient context for troubleshooting

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the dashboard to load and display data correctly, so that I can see my models and statistics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the dashboard loads THEN the system SHALL successfully fetch user statistics and display them
2. WHEN the dashboard loads THEN the system SHALL successfully fetch model data and display it in the UI
3. WHEN data loading fails THEN the system SHALL show appropriate error messages to the user
4. WHEN data is successfully loaded THEN the system SHALL update all relevant UI components
